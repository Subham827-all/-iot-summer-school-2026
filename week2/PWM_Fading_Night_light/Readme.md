# Arduino PWM LED Fade Effect

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a smooth LED fading effect using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** on an Arduino. Six LEDs connected to PWM-capable pins gradually increase in brightness (fade in) and then decrease in brightness (fade out), one LED at a time.

The program uses the `analogWrite()` function to control LED brightness by varying the PWM duty cycle.

## Pin Configuration

| LED   | Arduino PWM Pin |
| ----- | --------------- |
| LED 1 | D3              |
| LED 2 | D5              |
| LED 3 | D6              |
| LED 4 | D9              |
| LED 5 | D10             |
| LED 6 | D11             |

## Working Principle

1. All six LED pins are configured as outputs.
2. The program selects one LED at a time.
3. The LED brightness gradually increases from **0** to **255** (Fade In).
4. The brightness then gradually decreases from **255** to **0** (Fade Out).
5. After completing one LED, the program repeats the process for the next LED.
6. Once all six LEDs have faded in and out, the sequence starts again.

## PWM Brightness Levels

The Arduino controls LED brightness using PWM values:

| PWM Value | Brightness         |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 0         | OFF                |
| 64        | Low                |
| 128       | Medium             |
| 192       | High               |
| 255       | Maximum Brightness |
